# Comprehensive Example: Caching Slow Third-Party APIs with Redis

## Problem Scenario
You're building an e-commerce application that integrates with multiple external payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.). During peak traffic periods:
- Payment gateway APIs become slow (500-1000ms response times)
- Your checkout process becomes unresponsive
- Conversion rates drop due to poor user experience

## Solution Architecture
We'll implement Redis caching to:
1. Store successful API responses
2. Serve cached responses for identical requests
3. Automatically refresh stale data
